# KidneyGPS
RShiny web application for navigating genome-wide association study (GWAS) results and their functional and regulatory annotation to guide gene prioritization.

### Description
The KidneyGPS is available at https://kidneygps.ur.de/gps/. It summarizes information on association and annotation of variants and genes mapping to 424 genetic loci identified for glomerular filtration rate based on a GWAS meta-analysis of UK Biobank and CKDGen consortium data (n=1,201,909) [Stanzick et al. Nat. Commun. 2021]. Variants and genes were anotated using various data sources that are described in detail on the website.
